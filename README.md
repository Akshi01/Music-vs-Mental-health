# Music-vs-Mental-health
Music therapy, or MT, is the use of music to improve an individual's stress, mood, and overall mental health. MT is also recognized as an evidence-based practice, using music as a catalyst for "happy" hormones such as oxytocin.
The aim of the project was to identify if any correlations exist between an individual's music taste(and music, in general) and their self-reported mental health.
